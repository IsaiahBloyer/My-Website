# Welcome
## I'm Isaiah, but just call me Ike

{{< /div >}}

Hello! I'm Isaiah Bloyer, but primarly go by Ike. I grew up in South Florida with my American father, Colombian mother, and my two siblings. I'm a UCF Alumnus and graduated in December 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a Minor in Secure Computing and Networks. I'm also a trained and certified Apple T1 Mac+ advisor specializing in customer support, software troubleshooting, and hardware diagnosing.

Since the age of 5, tech has been one of my main hobbies. I still remember my uncle giving me a desktop computer and printer for my birthday and being ecstatic. I sat there for hours, printing anything I could type out, just wondering about the digital world. Since then, I've tried everything from building and taking apart computers, writing software, configuring networks, and more. I'm interested in it all and am eager to learn!

Outside of tech, I'm a baseball and football fan. Some may say that my choice in teams is a bit odd. Being from South Florida, I'm a Miami Hurricanes, Miami Dolphins, and Miami Marlins (despite our ongoing love-hate relationship) fan. In addition, my father is from Wisconsin, so I was exposed to and became a fan of the Green Bay Packers and Milwaukee Brewers. Lastly, I am a fan of UCF Knights, my alma mater.

I'm currently looking for employment either remotely or anywhere in Florida south of Orlando. Feel free to read my resume located at the top right or find my contact information down below!
